INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cozy corner café. Morning light streams through dusty windows.
ALEX, 30s, sits alone nursing a coffee. JORDAN enters.

JORDAN
You actually came.

ALEX
Did you think I wouldn't?

JORDAN
(sitting down)
I wasn't sure. After last night...

ALEX
Let's not talk about last night.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

JORDAN hurries out. ALEX follows, catching up.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Wait. I didn't mean it like that.

JORDAN
Then how did you mean it?

ALEX
I meant... I'm sorry.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

They return. The BARISTA brings two fresh cups.

NARRATOR
Some conversations change everything.

JORDAN
So what happens now?

ALEX
We figure it out. Together.
